# Hi, I'm Fernando González Rebollo

Frontend Developer in growth, with a background in **Web Application Development (DAW)** and real experience in **frontend development, CRO, and web optimization**.

I come from digital marketing, and that clearly shapes how I work: I focus on **user context, usefulness, performance, and conversion**, not just on writing code that “works”.

## How I work

- I like to understand the problem before writing code
- I care about building things that are actually used
- I value clarity, performance, and user experience
- I don’t oversell skills I’m still learning
